# About
This project aims to build the founding blocks of any blockchain to gain a deeper understanding of it.

Currently, it consists of two classes.

The blockchain.py class handles the blockchain itself and, most notably, has a method to generate hashes and build the blocks of the blockchain.

Transactions.py can handle transactions between two users of the blockchain.
