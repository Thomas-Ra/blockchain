# About
This project aims to build the founding blocks of any blockchain to gain a deeper understanding of it.

Currently, it consists of four classes.

blockchain.py class handles the blockchain itself and, most notably, has a method to generate hashes and build the blocks of the blockchain.

transactions.py can handle transactions between two users of the blockchain.

validations.py handles the validity of blocks, transactions and the chain itself.

mode.py is for possible future work to include other nodes in the blockchain.

demoChain.py is a working example of the classes working together.

# Future work
Future work could include a concrete network architecture to distribute the blockchain. If the blockchain is distributed we also need an proof of work or proof of stake validation that confirms transactions that manages how new blocks will be appended to the chain.

If everyone can contribute to the chain we also need a consesus mechanism.
