# About
This project aims to build the founding blocks of any blockchain to gain a deeper understanding on it.

Currently it consists of 2 classes.

The blockchain.py class handels the blockchain itself and most notebly has a method to generate hashes and build the blocks of the blockchain.

Transactions.py can handle transactions between two users of the blockchain.
